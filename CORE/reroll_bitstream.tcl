# Re-roll one board whose build only missed timing - normally called by
# build_all.sh after build_bitstream.tcl reported TIMING-FAILED:
#
#   vivado -mode batch -source reroll_bitstream.tcl -tclargs <board> <jobs> <wns> <whs>
#
# <wns> and <whs> are the slacks of the failed build. Every attempt continues
# from a checkpoint of that build, i.e. from the same synthesized and optimized
# netlist with the same constraints; only placement, routing and phys_opt are
# redone, with other directives. A hold miss is attacked with new placements
# first, because the placement decides for example the fabric route of the
# HyperRAM read strobe. A setup-only miss is attacked first with harder
# optimization and routing of the existing placement.
#
# The first attempt that meets setup and hold and passes the sign-off gates of
# build_bitstream.tcl replaces mega65_<board>.bit and mega65_<board>.mmi in
# CORE-<board>.runs/impl_1, and leaves mega65_<board>_reroll.dcp,
# mega65_<board>_reroll_timing.rpt and mega65_<board>_reroll.txt next to them.
# Prints one "REROLL <board> ..." line per attempt and one final
# "RESULT <board> ..." line. Exits 0 on success, 2 if no attempt met timing and
# 3 if a sign-off gate failed.
