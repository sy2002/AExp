# Build the MEGA65 bitstreams of all four boards (R3, R4, R5, R6) one after
# another in Vivado batch mode - made for overnight runs.
#
# Usage: ./build_all.sh [--no-reroll] [--help] [board ...]
#
#   cd CORE
#   source /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2022.2/settings64.sh   # or wherever Vivado is
#   nohup ./build_all.sh > build_all.out 2>&1 &
#
# Boards: optionally a subset, e.g. "./build_all.sh R4 R6"; the names are
# case-insensitive. Without boards, all four are built.
#
# Re-roll: once all boards are built, every board that only missed timing is
# implemented again with other placer and router directives (see
# reroll_bitstream.tcl), starting from the checkpoints of its own build, until
# an attempt meets timing. The winner replaces the failed
# CORE-<board>.runs/impl_1/mega65_<board>.bit, so every tool that expects the
# bitstream there keeps working, and the summary lists all attempts.
#
# Options:
#   --no-reroll  skip the re-roll pass, a board that missed timing stays failed
#   --help       print this text
#
# Environment:
#   JOBS=<n>              parallel Vivado jobs per run (default 4)
#   REROLL_MAX_MISS=<ns>  largest setup or hold miss that gets re-rolled
#                         (default 0.3); a bigger miss is a real timing problem
