; Dependent menu entries ("smart dependencies") for the Options Menu
;
; A menu line can be tagged in config.vhd with OPTM_DEP(mother, item) or
; OPTM_DEP2(mother, item_a, item_b) so that it is only visible while one of
; the items in a 4-bit item MASK of a specific "mother" group is selected
; (dependency format 2, config.vhd magic 0x2DEF). This is a pure visibility
; layer: dependent lines keep their own osm_control bit, their saved
; config-file byte and their default state; the VHDL side multiplexes the
; active variant explicitly. See doc/path-to-OSM-dependencies.md for the
; complete design.
;
; M2M-UPSTREAM osm-deps
; Ported into this M2M V2.0.1 instance from C64MEGA65, where the feature was
; introduced as its issue #229. The port is deliberately minimal: the four
; routines below are byte-for-byte the C64 originals. Two things differ from
; the C64 tree:
;   * OPTM_DEPS_MINHID is dropped. It only feeds a boot-time menu-height
;     warning that this M2M instance does not have.
;   * OPTM_G_LOAD_ROM lines MAY be dependent here. The restriction is not
;     implemented in OPTM_DEPS_VAL below but in the "special line" array that
;     the caller builds (see _HLP_DEP_OR in options.asm), so allowing it needs
;     no change to the validator. It is safe because a CRT/ROM line is bound to
;     its manual id by its position in the STATIC config array, not by what is
;     on screen: CRTROM_M_GI / CRTROM_M_NO count occurrences in
;     M2M$CFG_OPTM_CRTROM and are blind to dependency visibility. AExp needs
;     this because its ADF drives are mounted through the manual CRT/ROM
;     loader, and each drive line has a mount/hardware twin pair.
;
; This file is included at the end of menu.asm. The routines that operate on
; plain arrays (OPTM_DEPS_RESOLVE, OPTM_DEPS_VAL) are pure and directly
; testable in the QNICE emulator. OPTM_DEP_OK and OPTM_DEPS_AFFECTS
; additionally read the menu initialization record via OPTM_DATA (the single
; source of truth for the resolved dependency array and the live
; selected-state array).
;
; The raw per-line dependency word as served by SEL_OPTM_DEPS (config.vhd):
;   bit 12    : OPTM_G_DEPENDENT flag (1 = this line is dependent)
;   bits 11-8 : mother item mask (bit k = visible while member k is selected;
;               for a single-select mother: bit 0 = visible while it is off,
;               bit 1 = visible while it is on)
;   bits  7-0 : mother group id (1..254)
; The resolved per-line dependency word (produced by OPTM_DEPS_RESOLVE):
;   bit 15    : valid (1 = this line is dependent)
;   bits 11-8 : mother item mask (copied through from the raw word)
;   bits  7-0 : flat index of the FIRST member of the mother group

; OPTM_DEP_OK: Runtime visibility predicate for one menu line
;
; Reads the resolved dependency array, the (masked) groups array and the live
; selected-state array from the menu initialization record (OPTM_DATA). When
; the dependency feature is off (no record, or OPTM_IR_DEPS is 0) or the line
; carries no dependency, the line is always visible. Otherwise: for a
; single-select mother the line is visible iff mask bit <state of the mother
; line> is set; for a radio mother the members of the mother group are scanned
; from its first member on, the ordinal k of the currently selected member is
; determined, and the line is visible iff mask bit k is set (no selected
; member, or a selected member beyond bit 3: hidden).
;
; Input:
;   R8: flat index of the menu line to test
;
; Output:
;   C=1: the line is visible (dependency satisfied or no dependency)
;   C=0: the line is hidden by an unsatisfied dependency
;
;   All registers (including R8) are preserved.

; OPTM_DEPS_AFFECTS: Does a selectable group control any dependent line?
;
; Called after a selection change (a radio flip or a single-select toggle) to
; decide whether the visible menu structure may have changed and therefore
; needs a real-time redraw. Returns true if the group whose state just changed
; is the "mother" of at least one dependent line. Identifying the group by its
; (masked) group word is sufficient: members of one group share the same word,
; and group words are unique per group id.
;
; Input:
;   R8: the masked group word of the line whose state just changed
;
; Output:
;   C=1: the group controls at least one dependent line (redraw needed)
;   C=0: the group controls nothing (no dependents, or feature off)
;
;   All registers (including R8) are preserved.

;                               dependency words (incl. some-tagged/some-not)
;   class 3  ERR_F_DEPCHAIN   : a line of a mother group is itself dependent

;                               is flagged special by the caller (since

; SUBMENU and CLOSE lines are recognized from the groups array (bit 14); the

; (nonzero = special line). Which flags the caller folds into that array is
; the caller policy, not a property of this routine.
;
; Input:
;   R8: pointer to the (masked) groups array (N words)
;   R9: amount of menu items (N)
;  R10: pointer to the raw dependency array (N words)
;  R11: pointer to the special-line array (N words; nonzero = special)

;   C=1: error
;        R9:  error class (0..4, see above)
;        R10: flat index of the offending line
